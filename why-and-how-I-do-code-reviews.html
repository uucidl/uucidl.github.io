<h1 class="title">Why And How I Do Code Reviews</h1>
<span class="post-meta">2017-02</span>
<span class="post-meta">nicolas@uucidl.com</span>

<p>
Software is developped by teams. <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> Teams
add to and change their systems over time. In this context, teams
ensure that each system, or some of its parts, can be changed with
reasonable effort, while maintaining valuable properties.
</p>

<p>
Teams form bodies of practices around the systems they develop. By now
many software development teams have adopted code reviews
practices<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
There are broad and well known reasons for reviews such as catching
unwanted errors or enforcing homogeneity through the removal of a
creator's bias about their own work. In other domains and for similar
reason writers have editors and airplanes are flown with a
co-pilot. <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
When seen as a communication exchange, a mutual review of code can
also help form<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> and share knowledge and concepts
of a system.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the overt stated goals<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> motivating
us to adopt a practice, becoming aware of what a practice concretely
does can help us maximize its effectiveness, and magnify its most
unique effects.
</p>

<p>
A mutual review of code is unique in that it can simulate the situation
of one maintainer interacting with a part of a software system previously
unknown to them.
</p>

<p>
So beyond communication and double-checking, I think that code-reviews
can help ensure that parts of a software can be understood and changed
over time. (To preserve this, I prefer reviews starting with little
pre-exposure to the material, so they can be as unbiased as possible)
</p>

<p>
My goals are to check that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>concepts are used correctly,
</li>
<li>new concepts are sensible and shared,
</li>
<li>code is understood today, and will be tomorrow
</li>
<li>code is likely to be and to stay correct
</li>
<li>system and context specific long-term properties are preserved <sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I also focus first on long term properties of the system rather than
short-term ephemereal properties of the presented
implementation. Implementations can improve, while long-term
properties degrade easily.
</p>

<p>
When a change is made to a software system, it must be understandable
in terms of the pre-existing concepts of that system, or it must
introduce the new concepts that have been formed with its
documentation.
</p>

<p>
Code that can be understood has a manifest purpose. It communicates
what it does, throughout its existence, without unnecessarily hiding
its purpose and function. When it is made of multiple parts, these
parts have stable themes and goals, with visible interfaces
in-between.
</p>

<p>
Code is likely correct when tests exist that control what it does
today and tomorrow, with a manifest specification.
</p>

<p>
My strategy is to meet these goals as a sequence of reviews of
different focus. During each of these reviews, I write down my
questions and doubts without sharing them immediately with the author
of the change. These will be resolved along the way and raised to the
author according to their severity.
</p>

<p>
First a cursory review, which starts with the plain language
description of the changes, and a quick scan of the difference between
the old and the new version of the code. We ignore detailed commit
history at this point.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this cursory review is to gain insight as to what the
change is about, estimate the size of the review, and detect any high-
level oddity that clashes with our superficial understanding and
intuition.
</p>

<p>
It gives us a sense for the size of the change. The focus required for
a review can be intense. Rather than rushing we need to give ourselves
enough time and peace to do a good job with it.
</p>

<p>
This cursory review also simulates the situation of a maintainer
navigating the code in search for some of its features. Code that
cannot be understood superficially will be hard to navigate. So any
doubt flagged during this pass probably has to be raised in the end.
</p>

<p>
The second pass is a static detailed review of the total change. It
mimicks the situation of a team member trying to understand a piece of
code in order to later change it. Write down any question or
doubt. Collect notes about relationships between parts and resolve
questions that have been raised so far. If needed, open the files in
your actual development environment.
</p>

<p>
The third review goes through each commit in detail. This mimicks a
maintainer having to go through commits while bisecting or analyzing a
defect in detail.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing commits one after another should resolve and clarify most
questions that have been accumulated so far. These must still be
raised if they cause a significant burden to maintainers, such as when
they occur in interfaces.
</p>

<p>
We also check that the commit messages match the change they
contain. Do single commits make sense on their own? Does my
understanding of the change improves? If not then the commit might be
too fine grain.
</p>

<p>
At last we review our questions and raise questions and doubts left
unanswered directly to the author.
</p>

<p>
Raise first questions and issues that have the biggest impact on the
change and have long term impact on the system. Raise issues which
have to do with understanding and correctness.
</p>

<p>
Questions about concepts, interfaces and specification of tests should
therefore be addressed first. Questions that can help make the change
more economical in the concepts it introduces and local expertise it
requires are useful in the long run. <sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
We try to assess correctness mostly through the analysis of the tests.
This mimicks the situation of a future maintainer tasked with
refactoring the implementation, and tries to assess whether tests form
an economical executable description of the system's specifications.
</p>

<p>
Finally we raise issues/doubts about the implementation and other
engineering concerns such as risky runtime behaviors,
performance/memory usage.
</p>

<p>
Use care and apply good etiquette when you raise your issues. Respect
the author<sup><a id="fnr.8" name="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> and assume that they have asked
themselves many of the same questions you are asking yourself. Ask
what compromises or trade-offs were made (maybe they were
unfortunately left undocumented in commit messages or
documentation). Plain matters of taste "issues" are best left out.

And this, from a long time. Early examples
can be found in "The profiles of software designers and producers" by
Peter Naur, quoted as follows in the NATO Software Engineering
Conference Review (1968)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This way of developing the software and its
documentation also allows for mutual review, check, and criticism
within small groups of software programmers. This should take place
frequently while the work is in progress and can very well be done
within groups of two people who look into another’s work. In my
experience this is a highly effective way of organizing the software
work

A discipline of using checklists is a powerful way to
introduce more objectivity and predictability inside a practice.

Any practice produces results outside of their
official purpose, while failing to deliver some of its intended
results. In any complex organisation these remain either taboo,
undiscovered or informal. Like with drugs some of the results may be
positive or negative.
</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.6" name="fn.6" class="footnum" href="#fnr.6">6</a></sup> <p class="footpara">
Software systems and teams exist in a context. A
mature codebase with many users demands respect of its users' data and
time, so correctness and stability is highly important. Interfaces are
reused throughout the system so their stability is also important.
</p>

<p class="footpara">
On the other hand during the exploratory phase of a feature or system,
when concept are not entirely settled, properties such as how quickly
the system can be changed can lead us to desire a compact and small
code base that preserves many options open at the expense of
interface stability.
</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.7" name="fn.7" class="footnum" href="#fnr.7">7</a></sup> <p class="footpara">
As a system gets developped and a team
focuses on its parts one at a time, a codebase will almost always
become larger than what its team can be the expert of.
</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.8" name="fn.8" class="footnum" href="#fnr.8">8</a></sup> <p class="footpara">
I usually prefer to give final say to the author
unless questions of ethics or morals arise. Team members should feel
empowered to the maximum extent reasonable. Ultimately the change is
under their responsibility and they also have spent more time thinking
about the change than any reviewer has.
